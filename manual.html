<H1>Listener</H1>
First install <A HREF="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile</A>!<BR>
Then:
<PRE>
make install
</PRE>
Then run '<B>setlistener</B>' with as parameter the device to listen to.
<PRE>
setlistener /dev/dsp
</PRE>
Then, with the left and right arrow keys, move the '|' until the
word "<silence>" appears. No, don't you move the '|' to the maximum
right, move it to the right until the "<silence>" just constantly
appears. Then: remember the value "Current level: ".<BR>
<BR>
Next step is creating the file <B>/usr/local/etc/listener.conf</B>
Copy the example <B>listener.conf</B> to the location mentioned above and
edit it to suit your needs.<BR>
For example:
<PRE>
wav_path = /home/folkert/recordings
devname = /dev/dsp
detect_level = 800
min_duration = 1
max_duration = 300
rec_silence = 5
sample_rate = 44100
channels = 1
compression = ima-adpcm
format = wav
from_pipe = 0
exec = /home/folkert/encode_sample
prerecord_n_seconds = 3
</PRE>

<H2>format</H2>
Format sets what kind of outputfile is generated. Possible are:

</TABLE>

<H2>sample_rate</H2>
Sets the samplerate at which the samples are recorded.
Be warned: only the rates supported by your soundcard can be
entered here!<BR>

<H2>rec_silence</H2>
When while recording things become silent, don't stop recording immediately
but keep recording for 'rec_silence' seconds to see if the sound restarts.<BR>

<H2>min_duration</H2>
When the sound starts, record at least that many seconds of audio, measured
relative to the start of the recoding.<BR>
E.g. if the sound only sounds for 3 seconds and you've set this value to 5,
still at least 5 seconds of audio will be recorded.<BR>

<H2>min_triggers</H2>
sets how many samples must be above the threshold (the
'<B>detect_level</B>') before recording starts.
The samplerate is set to 44.1kHz so if you set min_duration to
4410, the minimum length (duration) of sound before the recording
starts is: 0.1s (or: one tenth of a second).<BR>

<H2>max_duration</H2>
How long a sample may be before a new file is started.<BR>

<H2>one_shot</H2>
When set to yes/on/1, listener will exit after the first recorded sample.<BR>

<H2>prerecord_n_seconds</H2>
How many seconds to record <I>before</I> the sound starts.<BR>

<H2>channels</H2>
Sets the number of channels to record. default is 1 which
is mono, 2 is stereo. Warning: some soundcards don't support
mono, listener will then exit with an errormessage.<BR>

<H2>compression</H2>
sets the compressionmethod. Can be:
<UL>
<LI>u-law
<LI>a-law
<LI>ima-adpcm
<LI>ms-adpcm
<LI>gsm-6.10
<LI>G721_32 (32kbit)
<LI>G723_24 (24kbit)
<LI>G723_40 (40kbit)
</UL>
If you omit the compression-line completely, no compression is
used.<BR>

<H2>from_pipe</H2>
sets wether listener is reading from a pipe fed by
<B>listenersoundpipe</B>. <B>listenersoundpipe</B> lets you split a sound-
device in two so that you can check 2 rooms with only one sound-
card. You need to create two pipes and start 2 listener processes,
each reading from one pipe.<BR>
Set this parameter to yes/on/1 for "pipe-mode", no/off/0 for normal mode.

<H2>exec</H2>
selects the script/program to execute after the sample was
recorded. This first (and only) parameter for that script is the
filename of the sample.<BR>

<H2>on_event_start</H2>
selects the script/program to execute before the sample was recorded.<BR>

<H2>output_pipe</H2>
Instead of writing to a wav-file, listener can also execute an external
program which does the compression and/or file-I/O.<BR>
e.g.:
<PRE>
output_pipe=bladeenc -rawstereo -rawsigned -rawchannels=2 STDIN /tmp/my_file.mp3
</PRE>

<H2>filter</H2>
lets you add one or more filters. these will be used when
detecting sounds. beware: sound is written to the wav-files BEFORE
the filtering is done. See the directory '<I>filter_lib_example</I>' for
an example on how to write a filter for listener.<BR>

<H2>amplify</H2>
Wether to automatically amplify the sound or not. Use 'on' and 'off' to
toggle.<BR>

<H2>start_amplify</H2>
What amplification to use when the sound starts. This will be adjusted
to something more applicable UNLESS 'fixed_amplify' is set to yes.<BR>

<H2>max_amplify</H2>
Maximum amplification to use.<BR>

<H2>fixed_amplify</H2>
Wether to ONLY use the amplification factor set with 'start_amplify'
(=yes) or let listener do autotuning (=no).<BR>

<B>safe_after_filter</B>sets wether to save the audio-data to disk
before or after the filtering. Before the filtering gives you the
original sound while after gives you the sound after processing
with the filter(s).<BR>
Enter '<B>on</B>' or '<B>off</B>'.<BR>

<BR>
The final step is starting the program:
<PRE>
listener
</PRE>
and that's it!<BR>
